# Appendix E.7 — Receipts

**Parent:** [Appendix E — ggen Pack Layout](e-ggen-pack-layout.md)

ggen is treated as a semantic manufacturing compiler: graph and query select meaning, templates render projections, validators reject malformed output, and receipts bind the generated artifact to the admitted subject. Generation is not evidence of correctness. The value of the generator is reproducibility and class closure—once a construction pattern is admitted, it can be regenerated for new subjects without rediscovering the pattern manually.

Standing belongs to an exact subject. Inspection is not execution, execution is not verification, and a named receipt file is not evidence that the intended transition occurred. A useful receipt binds identity, authority, consequence, verifier result, and replay instructions so a later observer can reconstruct why the standing claim was made.

## Minimal record

```text
subject = <exact identity>
observed = <bounded inputs>
admitted = <constraints and uncertainty>
authority = <SELECT|CONSTRUCT|DO>
executed = <observed action or NONE>
verified = <postcondition evidence>
receipt = <content identity>
replay = <deterministic reconstruction method>
standing = <bounded status>
```

## Standing rule

The evidentiary vocabulary is deliberately non-binary: `UNKNOWN`, `PARTIAL_ALIVE`, `ALIVE`, `BLOCKED`, `BUILD_BROKEN`, `UNSUPPORTED`, plus typed refusal where a request is understood but not lawfully admissible. `ALIVE` is reserved for observed execution against the exact admitted subject with verifier and replay evidence.
