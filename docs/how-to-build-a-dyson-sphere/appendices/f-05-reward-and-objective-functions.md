# Appendix F.5 — Reward and Objective Functions

**Parent:** [Appendix F — gymact Environment](f-gymact-environment.md)

GymAct provides counterfactual execution before physical consequence. A world model names its state, roles, policies, observation projections, action projections, authority, and episode boundaries. Simulation can falsify a candidate or expose missing constraints, but it cannot prove the physical world will behave identically; its standing is experimental evidence, not deployment evidence.

## Standing rule

The evidentiary vocabulary is deliberately non-binary: `UNKNOWN`, `PARTIAL_ALIVE`, `ALIVE`, `BLOCKED`, `BUILD_BROKEN`, `UNSUPPORTED`, plus typed refusal where a request is understood but not lawfully admissible. `ALIVE` is reserved for observed execution against the exact admitted subject with verifier and replay evidence.
