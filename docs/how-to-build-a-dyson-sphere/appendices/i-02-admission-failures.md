# Appendix I.2 — Admission Failures

**Parent:** [Appendix I — Failure Catalogue](i-failure-catalogue.md)

Observation becomes operational only after it is bounded. O* records exact subject identity, source provenance, units, uncertainty, validity interval, contradictions, and exclusions. UNKNOWN is preserved as a value rather than coerced into a guess. This makes later manufacture falsifiable: a design can be traced back to the measurements and assumptions it actually consumed.

Telemetry is raw observation, not standing. Weaver normalizes signals into semantic conventions, attaches resource identity and provenance, and forwards only bounded observations into admission. This avoids a common observability error: turning a successful scrape, log line, or span into a claim that the physical subject behaved correctly.

Failure is modeled as topology rather than surprise. The design objective is to keep a local defect from becoming a global loss: isolate failure domains, preserve safe trajectories, maintain independent shutdown, keep repair paths, and record enough event history for reconstruction. A failed collector should reduce capacity, not invalidate the entire swarm.

## Standing rule

The evidentiary vocabulary is deliberately non-binary: `UNKNOWN`, `PARTIAL_ALIVE`, `ALIVE`, `BLOCKED`, `BUILD_BROKEN`, `UNSUPPORTED`, plus typed refusal where a request is understood but not lawfully admissible. `ALIVE` is reserved for observed execution against the exact admitted subject with verifier and replay evidence.

## Operational significance

**Appendix I.2 — Admission Failures** is not retained as a label-only reference. This page sits on the irreversible boundary between choosing a possibility and changing the world. SELECT, CONSTRUCT, and DO are separate authorities. Search may explore many reversible candidates; construction may manufacture an artifact or counterfactual; only an explicitly admitted grant for the exact subject and consequence class can authorize DO. Access to a connector, credential, model, or command runner is capability—not authority.

## System contract

The brokered sequence is `intent -> exact-subject admission -> authority check -> consequence bound -> receipt reservation -> actuator -> observation -> reconciliation -> final receipt`. Relevant UNKNOWN refuses before DO. Ambiguous actuation does not turn into a retry loop. Replay verifies prior evidence and intentionally lacks an actuator edge. These separations keep autonomous operation from becoming ambient permission.

## Failure modes and falsifiers

Permanent falsifiers include accepting a nearby authority class, allowing a grant for one subject to mutate another, invoking an actuator before reservation is durable, promoting transport ACK to DONE, or letting a planner/model/hook manufacture its own authority. Any such edge is a constitutional defect even if the resulting state happens to be desirable.

## Evidence before promotion

For this subject, promotion requires evidence that intersects the claim: exact subject identity, the admitted inputs or assumptions, the verifier or observation boundary, and a reproducible result. Static structure can establish representational closure; simulated execution can establish bounded behavior; neither is silently promoted to real-world consequential standing. A changed subject, stale observation, failed replay, unresolved contradiction, or verifier that no longer intersects the claim revokes the prior standing and requires re-admission.
