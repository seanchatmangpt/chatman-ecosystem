# Appendix F.3 — Policy Schema

**Parent:** [Appendix F — gymact Environment](f-gymact-environment.md)

GymAct provides counterfactual execution before physical consequence. A world model names its state, roles, policies, observation projections, action projections, authority, and episode boundaries. Simulation can falsify a candidate or expose missing constraints, but it cannot prove the physical world will behave identically; its standing is experimental evidence, not deployment evidence.

SELECT, CONSTRUCT, and DO are separate authority classes. A planner may rank candidates; a constructor may render them; only a brokered authority path may cause consequence. BRCE enforces zero unreceipted actuation by binding intent, subject, authority, preconditions, execution result, postconditions, and replay metadata into a receipt.

## Minimal record

```text
subject = <exact identity>
observed = <bounded inputs>
admitted = <constraints and uncertainty>
authority = <SELECT|CONSTRUCT|DO>
executed = <observed action or NONE>
verified = <postcondition evidence>
receipt = <content identity>
replay = <deterministic reconstruction method>
standing = <bounded status>
```

## Standing rule

The evidentiary vocabulary is deliberately non-binary: `UNKNOWN`, `PARTIAL_ALIVE`, `ALIVE`, `BLOCKED`, `BUILD_BROKEN`, `UNSUPPORTED`, plus typed refusal where a request is understood but not lawfully admissible. `ALIVE` is reserved for observed execution against the exact admitted subject with verifier and replay evidence.
