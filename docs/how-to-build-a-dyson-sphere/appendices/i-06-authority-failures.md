# Appendix I.6 — Authority Failures

**Parent:** [Appendix I — Failure Catalogue](i-failure-catalogue.md)

Telemetry is raw observation, not standing. Weaver normalizes signals into semantic conventions, attaches resource identity and provenance, and forwards only bounded observations into admission. This avoids a common observability error: turning a successful scrape, log line, or span into a claim that the physical subject behaved correctly.

SELECT, CONSTRUCT, and DO are separate authority classes. A planner may rank candidates; a constructor may render them; only a brokered authority path may cause consequence. BRCE enforces zero unreceipted actuation by binding intent, subject, authority, preconditions, execution result, postconditions, and replay metadata into a receipt.

Failure is modeled as topology rather than surprise. The design objective is to keep a local defect from becoming a global loss: isolate failure domains, preserve safe trajectories, maintain independent shutdown, keep repair paths, and record enough event history for reconstruction. A failed collector should reduce capacity, not invalidate the entire swarm.

## Standing rule

The evidentiary vocabulary is deliberately non-binary: `UNKNOWN`, `PARTIAL_ALIVE`, `ALIVE`, `BLOCKED`, `BUILD_BROKEN`, `UNSUPPORTED`, plus typed refusal where a request is understood but not lawfully admissible. `ALIVE` is reserved for observed execution against the exact admitted subject with verifier and replay evidence.

## Operational significance

**Appendix I.6 — Authority Failures** is not retained as a label-only reference. This page sits on the irreversible boundary between choosing a possibility and changing the world. SELECT, CONSTRUCT, and DO are separate authorities. Search may explore many reversible candidates; construction may manufacture an artifact or counterfactual; only an explicitly admitted grant for the exact subject and consequence class can authorize DO. Access to a connector, credential, model, or command runner is capability—not authority.

## System contract

The brokered sequence is `intent -> exact-subject admission -> authority check -> consequence bound -> receipt reservation -> actuator -> observation -> reconciliation -> final receipt`. Relevant UNKNOWN refuses before DO. Ambiguous actuation does not turn into a retry loop. Replay verifies prior evidence and intentionally lacks an actuator edge. These separations keep autonomous operation from becoming ambient permission.

## Failure modes and falsifiers

Permanent falsifiers include accepting a nearby authority class, allowing a grant for one subject to mutate another, invoking an actuator before reservation is durable, promoting transport ACK to DONE, or letting a planner/model/hook manufacture its own authority. Any such edge is a constitutional defect even if the resulting state happens to be desirable.

## Evidence before promotion

For this subject, promotion requires evidence that intersects the claim: exact subject identity, the admitted inputs or assumptions, the verifier or observation boundary, and a reproducible result. Static structure can establish representational closure; simulated execution can establish bounded behavior; neither is silently promoted to real-world consequential standing. A changed subject, stale observation, failed replay, unresolved contradiction, or verifier that no longer intersects the claim revokes the prior standing and requires re-admission.
