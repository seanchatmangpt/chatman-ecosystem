# Appendix I.1 — Observation Failures

**Parent:** [Appendix I — Failure Catalogue](i-failure-catalogue.md)

Observation becomes operational only after it is bounded. O* records exact subject identity, source provenance, units, uncertainty, validity interval, contradictions, and exclusions. UNKNOWN is preserved as a value rather than coerced into a guess. This makes later manufacture falsifiable: a design can be traced back to the measurements and assumptions it actually consumed.

Telemetry is raw observation, not standing. Weaver normalizes signals into semantic conventions, attaches resource identity and provenance, and forwards only bounded observations into admission. This avoids a common observability error: turning a successful scrape, log line, or span into a claim that the physical subject behaved correctly.

Failure is modeled as topology rather than surprise. The design objective is to keep a local defect from becoming a global loss: isolate failure domains, preserve safe trajectories, maintain independent shutdown, keep repair paths, and record enough event history for reconstruction. A failed collector should reduce capacity, not invalidate the entire swarm.

## Standing rule

The evidentiary vocabulary is deliberately non-binary: `UNKNOWN`, `PARTIAL_ALIVE`, `ALIVE`, `BLOCKED`, `BUILD_BROKEN`, `UNSUPPORTED`, plus typed refusal where a request is understood but not lawfully admissible. `ALIVE` is reserved for observed execution against the exact admitted subject with verifier and replay evidence.
