# Appendix E.4 — Templates

**Parent:** [Appendix E — ggen Pack Layout](e-ggen-pack-layout.md)

ggen is treated as a semantic manufacturing compiler: graph and query select meaning, templates render projections, validators reject malformed output, and receipts bind the generated artifact to the admitted subject. Generation is not evidence of correctness. The value of the generator is reproducibility and class closure—once a construction pattern is admitted, it can be regenerated for new subjects without rediscovering the pattern manually.

## Standing rule

The evidentiary vocabulary is deliberately non-binary: `UNKNOWN`, `PARTIAL_ALIVE`, `ALIVE`, `BLOCKED`, `BUILD_BROKEN`, `UNSUPPORTED`, plus typed refusal where a request is understood but not lawfully admissible. `ALIVE` is reserved for observed execution against the exact admitted subject with verifier and replay evidence.
