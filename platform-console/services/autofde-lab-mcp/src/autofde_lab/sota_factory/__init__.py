"""AutoFDE Lab SOTA factory control plane.

The package represents benchmark targets, DecisionBasis architecture spaces,
experiment designs, score/frontier standing, and failure-driven learning. It is
SELECT/LEARN only: execution results are ingested from the governed GymAct /
benchmark runtime boundary.
