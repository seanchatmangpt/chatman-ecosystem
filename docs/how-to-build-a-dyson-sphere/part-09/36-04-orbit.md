# 36.4 Orbit

**Parent:** [36. Semantic Conventions](36-semantic-conventions.md)

## Claim

`Orbit` is not accepted as a label-only capability. In this book it denotes a bounded object, relation, constraint, measurement, or control concern whose role must be explicit in the larger semantic conventions system. The objective is to preserve useful design freedom while refusing transformations that hide physics, authority, or evidence.

Orbital state is not a location label; it is a dynamical state with uncertainty. In the two-body approximation, orbital period satisfies T²=4π²a³/μ, where a is semimajor axis and μ is the standard gravitational parameter. Operational designs must then add perturbations, multi-body effects, solar radiation pressure, station-keeping budgets, conjunction probability, and covariance growth.

The semantic layer exists to prevent identical reality from fragmenting into incompatible local names. Public vocabularies are preferred where they already express provenance, units, sensors, organizations, policy, preservation, and events. Custom terms are admitted only for genuinely new stellar-industrial meaning. Generated APIs, documents, schemas, simulations, and dashboards are projections over that graph rather than rival semantic authorities.

Telemetry is raw observation, not standing. Weaver normalizes signals into semantic conventions, attaches resource identity and provenance, and forwards only bounded observations into admission. This avoids a common observability error: turning a successful scrape, log line, or span into a claim that the physical subject behaved correctly.

## Model

\[T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a^3}{\mu}\]

Any numeric use of this relation is admitted only after units, parameter source, uncertainty, epoch, and approximation regime are recorded. Model validity is part of the subject, not metadata that may be discarded after calculation.

## Operationalization

The implementation path is `parse → route → admit/refuse → diagnose/repair → construct → actuate → receipt → replay → standing`. The decisive rule is that the semantic or analytical result produced in this subchapter has **no ambient execution authority**. It may change the candidate set, create a proof obligation, generate a simulation, or manufacture an intent. A consequential action still requires explicit subject identity, authority, preconditions, execution, postcondition verification, and a receipt.

A practical record for this topic should contain:

- exact subject and revision/epoch;
- observed inputs with units and provenance;
- admitted assumptions and explicit UNKNOWNs;
- candidate construction or policy;
- constraints and refusal conditions;
- required authority class: SELECT, CONSTRUCT, or DO;
- verifier and postcondition;
- receipt identity and replay method when consequence occurs;

## Evidence boundary

For `Orbit`, **inspection is not execution** and **simulation is not deployment**. A claim advances only as far as the strongest evidence actually observed. A stale ephemeris, synthetic telemetry stream, generated file, theorem about a simplified model, or successful API response cannot be silently promoted into evidence for the physical subject.

## Falsifier

The working claim for `Orbit` is falsified when the admitted subject violates a required physical invariant, the postcondition cannot be observed, the authority chain cannot be reconstructed, or replay produces a materially different result under the same subject and configuration identity.
